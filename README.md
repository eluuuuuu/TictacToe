Creating a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves the following steps:

Design the layout: Begin by designing the layout of the game using HTML and CSS. You can use a 3x3 grid with boxes for each cell. Use CSS to style the boxes and give them a border.

Add functionality: To add functionality, you can use JavaScript. Start by adding an event listener to each box, which triggers when a player clicks on a box. When the event listener is triggered, the box should be marked with the player's symbol.

Create the game logic: Next, create the game logic using JavaScript. The game should keep track of which player's turn it is and prevent players from clicking on a box that has already been marked. The game should also detect when a player wins or when the game is a draw.

Display the winner: Once a player wins or the game is a draw, display a message to indicate the winner or the draw.
